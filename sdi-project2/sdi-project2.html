<p>I use to spend my spare time playing World of Warcraft. I now play XboX instead. I will only play for a few hours, for the fact that I am in college full time. Four games I play are Gears of War, Call of duty, Skyrim and Battlefield. After gaming it is straight to code, which I do for about 10 hours a day. After coding I rest, then check my social media, and look over my code. After a full day, I sleep roughly 8 hours a night. That said I spend about 20 hours a day being productive. Giving me 4 hours of free time to myself. </p>
